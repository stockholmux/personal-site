This is the personal website of Kyle J. Davis. 

## History

In November 2022, with the dramatic and rapid shift of the tech industry away from Twitter to Mastodon, I began to become nostalgic for the days before large, corporate social media. I have had many tries at a personal blog or website over the years:

| Era | Platform | Content |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Mid-1990s   | GeoCities? AngelFire? I can't remember | My memory is fuzzy, I think I was interested in music and guitars at the time. |
| '02-'05-ish | Custom blogging engine based on the LAMP stack. | Travel, friends, some tech news and gadgets |
| '11-'18-ish | Medium | Databases and coding, mostly related to Redis |

At work, I've blogged in various locations, often related to whatever role I had at the time.

## What now?

I'm hoping to get back into personal blogging. I've become a better writer over the years and it doesn't take me as long as it once did. I also want to share some stuff about my geeky hobbies that don't quite fit on social media as a primary platform.

A few topics you may see from me here:
* 3D Printing and modeling
* Home Assistant and smart home stuff
* Gardening
* DIY and household projects

Occasionally, you might also see random tech related content that is outside the above areas. 

## Goals

I don't have a huge amount of goals for this site. I think in my previous personal site iterations, I put too much pressure on myself to do _something_ with the blog. If I'm honest, I do credit blogging on Medium with getting my foot into the door with a real tech company but I don't think I'm looking to do anything like that this time around.
